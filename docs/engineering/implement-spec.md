## What it does

`implement-spec` takes one or more issues (a [spec](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/spec) with its [tickets](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/ticket), a single ticket, or a large issue with no tickets yet) and takes each one to a reviewed pull request in one run. Every issue becomes a **lane** with its own **integration branch**. The orchestrating [agent](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/agent) hands each ticket to an implementer [subagent](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/subagent) working in its own git worktree, merges each finished branch into its lane, runs the database and integration checks itself one lane at a time, runs [code-review](https://aihero.dev/skills-code-review) once per lane, has the findings fixed, and only then opens the lane's PR.

It reads the tickets as a **task graph**, not a list. Blocking edges decide what can start, so at any moment there is a **frontier** of tickets whose blockers have all landed, and every ticket on the frontier runs at once. That is the difference from working the tickets one by one. The graph's shape sets the pace, not the tickets' order on the tracker. With several issues, every lane's frontier runs at the same time, so the run replaces starting one `/implement` session per issue and passing messages between them.

## When to reach for it

You invoke this by typing `/implement-spec`, and the agent won't reach for it on its own.

| Your situation | Reach for |
| --- | --- |
| A spec, split into tickets with blocking edges, that you want landed in one run | `/implement-spec` |
| Several issues you want built in parallel, one PR each | `/implement-spec SOPO-229 SOPO-230 SOPO-231` |
| One ticket at a time, in your own [context window](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/context-window), [clearing](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/clearing) between tickets | [implement](https://aihero.dev/skills-implement) |
| A spec that isn't split into tickets yet | [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets) first, or let `implement-spec` split it and record the split as an `Assumption:` on the issue |
| A small piece of work with no real graph to it | [implement](https://aihero.dev/skills-implement) directly |

## Prerequisites

- **An issue tracker.** The skill reads the tickets from, and resolves them on, the tracker [setup-matt-pocock-skills](https://aihero.dev/skills-setup-matt-pocock-skills) configured. If none has been configured, it stops and tells you to run that first rather than guessing.
- **Tickets with blocking edges**, as [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets) writes them. Without edges the graph is flat and every ticket starts at once. An issue with no tickets is either built as a single ticket or, when it is too big for one implementer, split by the run itself.
- **A [harness](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/harness) that runs subagents in the background and gives each one a git worktree.** The skill exists to run tickets at the same time, so on a harness that runs subagents one at a time, it is only a slower `implement`.

## The integration branch

Each lane lands on one branch. Each implementer:

1. confirms its worktree is based on its lane's integration branch before it starts,
2. builds its ticket with [tdd](https://aihero.dev/skills-tdd), red-green one slice at a time,
3. merges the integration branch tip into its own branch before reporting done, so landing it is a fast-forward.

Implementers never start a database or container. The orchestrator runs that verification itself, one lane at a time on one database slot, so parallel lanes never fight over local infrastructure. A failing test gets one solo re-run; if it passes it is reported as flaky rather than fixed.

The tracker decides whether a pull request exists at all. If your tracker closes work through PRs, or you ask for one, each lane's PR opens once, at the end, ready for review: after verification, review, fixes, and a check that parallel lanes did not pick the same migration version. Its body collects every `Assumption:` comment, each finding left unfixed with the reason, follow-up issues, and flaky tests. Otherwise the run stops on each integration branch with every ticket resolved the way your tracker closes work, which works fully offline against a local markdown tracker.

Implementers talk to the orchestrator through [context pointers](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/context-pointer) (the spec, the ticket, shared exploration notes, earlier commits) rather than pasted summaries. This keeps each subagent's prompt small and leaves room in the orchestrator's window for the graph.

## Common questions

**How is this different from running `/implement` on each ticket myself?**

This is the question the skill exists to answer. Before it shipped, people kept building their own versions, and one user described the need: they wanted "subagents implement the tickets" instead of having "to individually create new session and tell them to implement a ticket one by one, when a spec may contain over 5 tickets." With `implement` you are the dispatcher: one [session](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/session) per ticket, clearing in between, and keeping track yourself of which tickets are unblocked. `implement-spec` hands that job to one orchestrating session. The price is that you no longer read each ticket's work as it lands; you review the integration branch at the end. To start a run, clear the context and type `/implement-spec` with a pointer to the spec (an issue number or a file path). For a small change with no real graph, skip it and use `implement` directly.

**Does it need GitHub? I want it to stop at the branch.**

No, not any more. One user who liked the in-progress version had exactly this complaint: "it creates a PR at the end, which requires an online repository like GitHub. I wish it could do the same work offline and stop at the branch where all the work is merged." The run now ends on the integration branch. A PR opens only when the configured tracker closes work through PRs or you ask for one, so on a local markdown tracker the run ends with every ticket resolved and the work merged on the branch.

**Its review and fix loop ran for hours, or kept "fixing" tickets that hadn't been built yet.**

Both happen when `code-review` runs anywhere other than the one point the skill gives it. It compares the code against the whole spec, so it only makes sense once every ticket in the lane has landed. If it runs mid-run, every unbuilt ticket reads as a failure. The agent then builds that ticket, and that triggers another review. One user reported a five-ticket feature where "the review and fix loop took roughly four hours". The skill now gives each lane exactly one review, sends every finding to one fix subagent, and re-checks the fixes with focused tests only; a fix never triggers a second review. If you still see a second broad review start, that is the bug. Expect that first review to find real problems. The run's output is a draft that the review completes, not something to ship on its own.

**Does it drive tdd like implement does?**

It does now, though it didn't at first. Users running the in-progress version noticed that "the implementer subagents don't inherit the /tdd directive", so red-green stopped as soon as they scaled up from one ticket to a whole spec. Each implementer now builds its ticket with `tdd`. There is still no step where you agree seams interactively, as there is in an `implement` session, so name the seams in the spec or the tickets if you want them pinned.

**Two implementers running in parallel collided on the same file, or picked different names for the same thing.**

Worktrees don't remove collisions; they postpone them to merge time. A blocking edge written from ticket text is a guess about which files each ticket will touch, and two tickets on "different parts of the codebase" still share a message catalogue, a config registry, or a type. Each implementer sees only its own ticket and the shared notes, never the other's work in progress, so one user's web and mobile tickets added the same string as `blockedSince` and `blockedOn`. When two frontier tickets touch one shared file, either add a blocking edge between them so they run one after the other, or have the exploration notes fix the exact names each ticket adds.

**Blocked tickets never start, even after their blocker has merged.**

This is a known problem on GitHub. The tracker's blocked-by count only drops when a blocker *closes*, and tickets typically close when the PR merges, which is the end of the run. The tracker is the right source for the starting graph but a stale one mid-run. Tell the orchestrator to track which tickets have merged into the integration branch itself and compute the frontier from that.

**Does this replace Sandcastle or an AFK script?**

No. People ask because the skills now reach into implementation: "is Sandcastle still relevant? Your skills now seem to be able to handle implementation as well." `implement-spec` puts an agent in charge of orchestration inside one harness session, which needs no infrastructure and lets you watch and steer. For work that is truly [AFK](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/afk), a deterministic loop ([Sandcastle](https://github.com/mattpocock/sandcastle), a shell script, a CI job) is faster, cheaper, and more reliable, because no agent makes the orchestration decisions.

**A ticket's key test was skipped inside its worktree, and it reported green.**

A worktree holds only what git tracks. Tests that read gitignored fixtures, local databases, or credentials can silently skip there. For a ticket whose verification depends on untracked material, tell the orchestrator to run it in the main checkout instead.

## It's working if

- Several implementers are running at once whenever the graph allows, not one after another.
- A ticket starts as soon as its last blocker lands on the integration branch, not when the whole run ends.
- Every ticket's trace shows `tdd` running, with a failing test before the code.
- Merges into the integration branch are fast-forwards, not conflict resolutions.
- Only one lane at a time holds a database slot, and none is left running at the end.
- Each lane's trace shows one `code-review` call, after its verification and before its PR.
- The run ends with one table, a row per lane, and a PR per lane only if your tracker wanted one.

## Where it fits

`implement-spec` is the build step of the main chain, as the parallel alternative to running [implement](https://aihero.dev/skills-implement) once per ticket:

```txt
grill-with-docs → to-spec → to-tickets → implement-spec (code-review per lane) → retro
```

Its neighbours are [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets), which declares the blocking edges it reads as a task graph, and [code-review](https://aihero.dev/skills-code-review), which it runs over each lane's integration branch before opening that lane's PR. [ask-matt](https://aihero.dev/skills-ask-matt) is the router over the whole set when you are not sure which flow you are in.
