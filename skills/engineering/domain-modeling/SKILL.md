# Domain Modeling

Actively build and sharpen the project's domain model as you design. This is the *active* discipline: challenging terms, inventing edge-case scenarios, and writing the glossary and decisions down the moment they crystallise. (Merely *reading* `GLOSSARY.md` for vocabulary is not this skill: that's a one-line habit any skill can do. This skill is for when you're changing the model, not just consuming it.)

## File structure

<!-- fork: this repo keeps one GLOSSARY.md and no decision files; decisions go to the issue tracker -->

```
/
├── GLOSSARY.md
└── src/
```

If a `GLOSSARY-MAP.md` exists at the root, the repo has multiple contexts, and the map points to each context's `GLOSSARY.md`.

Create files lazily: only when you have something to write. If no `GLOSSARY.md` exists, create one when the first term is resolved.

## During the session

### Challenge against the glossary

When the user uses a term that conflicts with the existing language in `GLOSSARY.md`, call it out immediately. "Your glossary defines 'cancellation' as X, but you seem to mean Y. Which is it?"

### Sharpen fuzzy language

When the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term. "You're saying 'account': do you mean the Customer or the User? Those are different things."

### Discuss concrete scenarios

When domain relationships are being discussed, stress-test them with specific scenarios. Invent scenarios that probe edge cases and force the user to be precise about the boundaries between concepts.

### Cross-reference with code

When the user states how something works, check whether the code agrees. If you find a contradiction, surface it: "Your code cancels entire Orders, but you just said partial cancellation is possible. Which is right?"

### Update GLOSSARY.md inline

When a term is resolved, update `GLOSSARY.md` right there. Don't batch these up: capture them as they happen. Use the format in [GLOSSARY-FORMAT.md](./GLOSSARY-FORMAT.md).

`GLOSSARY.md` should be totally devoid of implementation details. Do not treat `GLOSSARY.md` as a spec, a scratch pad, or a repository for implementation decisions. It is a glossary and nothing else.

### Record decisions sparingly

<!-- fork: never write an ADR file. Piling up decision files makes them unsearchable; a decision lives where its work does. -->

Only record a decision when all three are true:

1. **Hard to reverse**: the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context**: a future reader will wonder "why did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off**: there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If any of the three is missing, record nothing. When all three hold, never create a file. Record it in the three places the repo's `docs/agents/domain.md` names: the spec's `Implementation Decisions` on the issue tracker, a comment at the code saying why, and a `Decision:` line in the commit or PR. [ADR-FORMAT.md](./ADR-FORMAT.md) says what qualifies.
